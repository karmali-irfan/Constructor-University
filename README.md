# Constructor-University-Coursework
Welcome to my University Coursework Repository! This repository contains the coursework and projects I've completed as part of my studies in various programming and engineering disciplines. Feel free to explore the different folders and projects to gain insights into my journey through the following courses:

## 1. Programming in C and C++
This section includes assignments, labs, and projects related to programming using the C and C++ languages. You'll find a variety of coding exercises and applications showcasing my skills in these languages.

## 2. Arduino Projects
Here, you'll discover a collection of projects and experiments involving Arduino microcontrollers. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with hardware components, program microcontrollers, and create interactive systems.

## 4. RISProject
The RISProject folder contains coursework and projects related to a Duckiebot in Duckietown. Machine Learning algorithms like Object Detection and Lane Detection were implemented to allow the Duckiebot to detect lanes and objects (Duckiebots and Ducks) as it navigated Duckietown.

## 5. Computer Vision
In this section, I delve into the exciting field of Computer Vision. You'll find assignments and projects that demonstrate my understanding of image processing, object detection, and other computer vision techniques.

## 6. Embedded Systems
Explore this folder to find coursework and projects focused on Embedded Systems. These projects highlight my skills in designing and programming embedded systems, showcasing my ability to work with low-level hardware and software.

# How to Navigate the Repository
Each course has its dedicated folder, and within each folder, you'll find subfolders and files for different projects, assignments, and labs. Here's a quick guide to navigating the repository:

- **Course Folder**
  - Contains subfolders for individual projects or topics within the course.
  - Each project/topic subfolder includes its own README file, providing details about the project, its goals, and how to run or use it.

Feel free to browse through the repository, explore the code, and gain insights into my academic journey and technical skills development.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to run any of the projects or explore the code, follow the instructions provided in the respective README files within each project's subfolder. You may need specific software, libraries, or hardware components to successfully run some projects.
