# Computer-Vision
This section explores the exciting field of Computer Vision. It includes assignments and projects that demonstrate my understanding of image processing, object detection, and other computer vision techniques.

  - **A few concepts that were covered in this course are as follows**
    -  Camera Calibration
    -  Computing image histograms, and basic image processing
    -  Discriminating visual features (corners, edges, line)
    -  Proper use of Computer Vision Libraries
    -  Implementing Computer Vision applications

## How to Run the Files

I would recommend the use of Jupyter Notebook for user-friendliness and an interactive coding experience. Follow the steps below to run the projects and assignments using Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed)**:
   If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
